# 🌐 Social Media App — Oracle APEX

A lightweight, functional **social media web app** built using Oracle APEX — designed to showcase how APEX can be used to rapidly develop modern, interactive applications with minimal backend configuration.

## 📌 Overview

This project simulates a **mini social platform**, allowing users to post, interact, and explore a social feed. Built using Oracle APEX's declarative UI components, it demonstrates core CRUD functionality, session management, and UI theming — all without writing heavy front-end code.
